🚀 **Building in Public**: My Journey to Creating a Course-Selling Platform! 💻

I’m excited to share that I’ve just crossed a major milestone in building the backend of my course-selling app! 📚

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

- ✅ Initialized a new Node.js project
- ✅ Added essential dependencies like Express, jsonwebtoken (JWT), and Mongoose
- ✅ Set up authentication for **users** and **admins**
- ✅ Created routes for:
  - User sign-up, login, course purchase, and viewing all/purchased courses
  - Admin sign-up, login, course creation, deletion, and adding course content
- ✅ Defined schemas for **User**, **Admin**, **Course**, and **Purchase** in MongoDB
- ✅ Used dotenv to securely connect to the database
- ✅ Built middlewares for user/admin authentication 🔐
- ✅ Optimized route structures using Express routing

🎯 **Next steps**: I’m gearing up to complete the frontend, and soon, this platform will be up and running!

I’ll be sharing regular updates on how the frontend comes together. If you’re interested in the tech stack or want to exchange ideas, feel free to drop a comment!
