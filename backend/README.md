# course-selling


I’m excited to share that I’ve just crossed a major milestone in building the backend of my course-selling app! 📚
- ✅ Initialized a new Node.js project
- ✅ Added essential dependencies like Express, jsonwebtoken (JWT), and Mongoose
- ✅ Set up authentication for **users** and **admins**
- ✅ Created routes for:
  - User sign-up, login, course purchase, and viewing all/purchased courses
  - Admin sign-up, login, course creation, deletion, and adding course content
- ✅ Defined schemas for **User**, **Admin**, **Course**, and **Purchase** in MongoDB
- ✅ Used dotenv to securely connect to the database
- ✅ Built middlewares for user/admin authentication 🔐
- ✅ Optimized route structures using Express routing

🎯 **Next steps**: I’m gearing up to complete the frontend, and soon.
